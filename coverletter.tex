Hello Reddit!

I am writing in regards to becoming a Reddit employee and I believe I'm a great fit for the IT Specialist position and I am very excited to hear about it. I have a strong commitment and passion for information technology and development.

In my previous job, I was able effectively automate ticket handling for troubled conference rooms, lowering the first response by over fifty percent. This showcased my skills in recognizing problems and using the right tools to fix them, while also automating away a tedious task that freed up time to work on the harder problems.

I've always been diligent and careful in my work. By keeping things organized, it allows me to see trends in support requests which can help write documentation for common tasks.

I love to learn about new technologies, even as an operations engineer, I would try everyday to learn about something new, whether if it was for a hobby or for using it in my career. Lately I've been using lots of online courses to expand on my knowledge of operating system administration and I want to be able to help anyone I can with my skill-set. 

I look forward to contributing my skills to the position and I would love to talk about how I would be a welcome asset to the team.

Sincerely,

Diana Arrieta
