Hello [company]!

I am writing in regards to being an [company] employee and I believe I'm a great fit for the role and I am very excited to hear about it. I have a strong commitment and passion for information technology and development.

In my previous job, I was able effectively automate ticket handling for troubled conference rooms, lowering the first response by over fifty percent. This showcased my skills in recognizing problems and using the right tools to fix them.

I've always been diligent and careful in my work, always trying to figure out what people really need when they make a request. This allowed me to work with many smaller teams and even collaborate on projects with them.

I love to learn about new technologies, even as an operations engineer, I would try everyday to learn about something new, whether if it was for a hobby or for using it in my career.

I look forward to contributing my skills to the position and I would love to talk about how I would be a welcome asset to the team.

Sincerely,

Diana Arrieta
